Create virtual environment:

python -m venv .venv

Activate virtual environment:
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat


Requirements:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Might change later depending on the project.

pip install deepchem


Exploratory and data folder:

The exploratory folder is not currently link to the data folder (i.e., it won't create it in that folder) because I did it in my local machine and I'm currently migrating it to github. I will fix this later.
